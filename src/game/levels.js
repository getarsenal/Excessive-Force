/**
 * Level registry.
 *
 * A level is a real place plus a list of structures to raise on it. Everything
 * else — destruction, stability, the garrison, the economy, the camera — is
 * generic, so adding a landmark means writing one builder and one entry here,
 * plus its coordinates in `tools/bake_terrain.py`.
 *
 * `primary` marks the landmark the level is named after — the one the height
 * and lean readouts track. `required` marks a structure that has to come down
 * for the level to be won.
 *
 * Every structure holding a garrison is required. A wing full of defenders that
 * could be ignored entirely was a strange thing to put in front of a player:
 * it shot at them the whole match and then took no part in whether they had
 * finished. If it is worth defending it is worth destroying.
